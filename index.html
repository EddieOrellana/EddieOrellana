          <h2> About Me: </strong> </h2>

          <p> My name is Edwin Orellana, but everyone calls me Eddie, I currently am an Automotive Technician for Lexus Australia. I have been working in the Automotive Industry for over 9 years now, I have had the opportunity in these past few years to work for many Automotive brands such as Mazda, Volkswagen, and the Mopar Group (Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat and Abarth). Apart from my love of cars I also do love technology, the I.T industry is growing more day after day, and I want to begin my journey to explore it. During my time as an apprentice one of my mentors would constantly express a saying that resonated with me and now, I try my best to apply it in my life daily “A day in which we have learnt nothing or not helped someone is a day wasted”. My goal is wanting to expand my knowledge and help those around me whenever the opportunity is given. </P>

              <p> <strong> • What do the results of these tests mean to me?: </strong> </p>
              <p> What these results mean to me is that I am an individual that is well balanced between working alone on a task or completing it with a group/team. Its shows that I am aware and conscious of how others around me are feeling. Also, it shows I am one who wants to help and assist when I can in however I can and happy to follow instruction, find new solutions and see not just my own perspective but others as well. My results also show that I am a Visual Learner and that through my vision that I can remember, learn, and understand things better. </p>


              <br>

              <p> <strong> • How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong> </p>
              <p> Based on my results I do think I would work well in a team; from the results I can see that I am considerate of other perspectives, feelings, and involvement. I think my behaviour would be involved, active and contributing to any team. </p>

              <br>

              <p> <strong> • How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong> </p>
              <p> I think the most important thing to take into consideration when forming a team (no matter the project or work required). Is to make the team as balanced as possible, because if everyone is too similar and has the same strengths and weaknesses then we all as a team will struggle in completing the overall task at hand. However, if the team is well balanced and has a good variety of personalities, strengths, and weaknesses then we can assist one another better. The strong in some areas can assist the weaker and vice versa in all areas of the project and more diverse the team the more perspectives can be explored as a team. </p>

          <article id='My Interest in IT'>
            <div class="My Interest in IT">
              <h2> My interest in IT:  </h2>

              <br>

              <p> <strong> • What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?  </strong> </p>
              <p> My interest in the Information Technology industry is the ever-expanding benefits and impact it has to our everyday lives. From the smallest apps we frequently use on our phones and portable devices to the advancements and improvements technology has brought us in hospitals, communication and even safety features in something as common as our transportation vehicles. During my time in the automotive industry, I have seen so many changes and improvements done in both the features, internals, and drivetrains of the vehicles I have worked on, to the equipment and diagnostic methods we use to work on them thanks to advancements in technology. This has caused me to be interested in learning more about how technology is also changing the world in other areas as well. Technology is constantly growing and one day I want to assist in its growth. The event that really opened my eyes to see that Technology is not just for entertainment and pass times, but a very important tool was when my nephew Sebastian was born in August of 2016. Unfortunately, my nephew was born with a Diaphragmic Hernia and part of his intestinal system was in the area where his left lung should have been. As a result of this my nephew passed away three days later, but during this hard time I saw how useful Technology can be. I saw how the advancements in the equipment used in the Hospital was assisting my nephew, other unwell children, and their families. I saw how through social media and other communication platforms my brother and his wife received an overwhelming amount of support from family and friends. Also ordering food and other necessities we needed were made easy through apps in our devices, this way our family could stay together as much as possible during this difficult period.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p> <strong> • Why did you choose to come to RMIT?  </strong> </p>
              <p> There are many reasons why I chose to come to RMIT. One of the reasons comes from when I was in year 9 (in 2009) and all the students in my year level were made to participate in the “City Centre Project”. During the 2 weeks we participated in the program we had to travel into Melbourne CBD every day, I remember coming out of Melbourne Central station and while traveling towards our desired destination we walked past the RMIT University Melbourne City Campus Building. I remember being captured by the unique design of the building and since then my interest grew for RMIT. As the years went by my path took me into the Automotive industry, but I had many friends and family that attended RMIT. From each of them I heard so many positive and wonderful things about the university and from it my interest continued to grow. I recently found myself at a point in my life where I could attend a university for the first time and naturally RMIT still remained as my first choice. </p>

              <br>
              <br>

              <p> <strong> • What do you expect to learn during your studies?: </strong> </p>
              <p> What I wish to learn during my studies is a greater understanding of Information Technology. From the benefits and convinces it brings to those using the apps, software’s, devices etc. To the work that goes into creating these products. The methods required to take an idea and make it into a reality. I may not know much at this moment, but I want to grow, learn, and make the most of this opportunity that I can.  </p>

              <H1> My Project Idea </H1>
              <br>
              <br>

              <img src="MyProjectDrawUp.jpg" style="width:auto;" >


              <p> <strong> Overview: </strong> </p>
              <p> My idea is for a Security system that the owner of a toolbox can use to keep an eye on their hard-earned tools and toolbox. The owner and user of this security system will be able to rest easy knowing that the security of their tools, valuables and equipment is not only protected by the original lock and key, but also by the toolbox security system as well. This system will allow the user to know if and which section of their toolbox has been opened without their consent while they have been away, furthermore also providing an image of the event recorded as well and stored into a Micro SD card for easy reading. And in any instance a tool or belonging of the user goes missing they have some form of evidence and an image of the culprit that took what is found to be missing.  </p>

              <br>

              <p> <strong> Motivation: </strong> </p>
              <p> As it stands the vast majority of Automotive Technicians around the world are required to provide their own tools and toolboxes for their jobs. This means they must use money from their own pockets to purchase their tools, toolboxes and specialized equipment to be able to work and heavily rely heavily on them daily. To a technician their tools are more than just equipment to complete tasks at work, their toolboxes and tool collections are a huge part of themselves reflected in their equipment. Unfortunately, it is not an uncommon occurrence that a technician’s tools or toolboxes are damaged or even have tools, belongings and valuables stolen from their toolboxes. This can occur during work hours while the person is away from their work area or even after work hours before the entire workshop building has been locked. Also, there are instances when others borrow tools without asking while the individual is away and forget to return them. But I personally feel that security for toolboxes only relies on the standard lock and key. I have noticed in my 9 years in the Automotive Industry and in every workshop, I have worked at is that the first thing most mechanics do once they have arrived at their work area in the morning is to place their phones into their toolboxes and when they carry out road tests and other duties outside the workshop, they always take their phones with them at all times in case of emergencies. So why not use this habit that is already engraved in most technicians and apply it to a security system that will benefit them and their tools all together. Especially when you consider most technicians have spent thousands of dollars in their toolboxes, tools and equipment, I personally estimate in my 9 years as a technician I have spent easily over $20,000 in my tool collection alone.</p>

              <br>

              <p> <strong> Descritption: </strong> </p>
              <p> The way the toolbox security system works is with the ESP32 Arduino Board which connects to the user’s mobile device via Wi-Fi signal emitted by the Arduino board. This then acts as a “switch” to activate and deactivate the security system. While the user is nearby, and their phone is connected to the Arduino board, the system will then have the motion sensors and camera turned off.  Once the user leaves and takes their phone with them and the phone is out of range from the Wi-Fi signal then the Arduino activates the camera and motion sensors to start monitoring. The security system will remain in an idle state until the motion sensors are triggered by the movement of someone approaching the toolbox. The triggering of the motion sensors will then send a signal to the Arduino board, the board will then activate the camera and then capture a series of images which are then transferred and stored into the expandable memories card stored in the control box. The contents of the control box will be the Esp32 Arduino board, a rechargeable power source and a SD memory card, also to reduce cost the control box will be 3D printed.  This control box will be able to be mounted to any desired location on the toolbox via 3m tape, that way the user can avoid drilling holes into their toolbox, which can cause corrosion over time and damage to their toolbox.  Also, an added benefit of the 3m tape is that the control box can be remounted to a different location if required without damage to the paint of the toolbox. Another feature to this security system is the user will be able to know which section of their toolbox has been opened while they have been away. Part of the kit will be a small light panel with a series of LEDs, each LED will be numbered corresponding to the number of drawers on the toolbox they have been fitted to. Next to each drawer of the toolbox will be fitted a magnetic sensor via 3m tape, this sensor will be tripped when any drawer is opened while the system has been activated. Each drawer will be fitted with a small magnet on the side panel facing the sensor, when the drawer is opened and the sensor is triggered by the magnet on the sider of the drawer this will alert the Arduino to light up the LED on the panel corresponding to that drawer’s number that has been opened. So, when the user returns to their toolbox, they can see from the light panel that a drawer and know which drawer from their toolbox has been opened while they have been away. The user can then remove the SD card and using an adapter provided in the kit they can upload the images captured by the camera to their device and view the event that has been captured. Once the user has viewed the images, cleared the memory card, reinstalled the memory card and reset the system they can carry on working.  </p>
