<h3> About Me: </strong> </h3>

<p> My name is Edwin Orellana, but everyone calls me Eddie, I currently am an Automotive Technician for Lexus Australia. I have been working in the Automotive Industry for over 9 years now, I have had the opportunity in these past few years to work for many Automotive brands such as Mazda, Volkswagen, and the Mopar Group (Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat and Abarth). Apart from my love of cars I also do love technology, the I.T industry is growing more day after day, and I want to begin my journey to explore it. During my time as an apprentice one of my mentors would constantly express a saying that resonated with me and now, I try my best to apply it in my life daily “A day in which we have learnt nothing or not helped someone is a day wasted”. My goal is wanting to expand my knowledge and help those around me whenever the opportunity is given. </P>
